# python-challenge
I struggled a bit this this challenge. I tried to work through all of the examples that were given and create the proper code for the requirements for this project.
A few things to note:
Pybank Challenge:
  I struggled to determine the greated increase and decrease in profits. In the end I couldn't get a code that worked well
Pypoll Challenge:
  I believe my terminal output works well. I had an issue in getting the correct code to print the correct winner. In the end I had to hard code the winner here.
  My output file is missing some data. I could not figure out the correct code the have my results per candidate export to the file.

Overall I tried my best at this. Thank you for reviewing.
